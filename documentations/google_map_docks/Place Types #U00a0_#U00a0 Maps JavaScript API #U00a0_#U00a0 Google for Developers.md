Place types are categories that identify the characteristics of a place. A place can have one or more
place types assigned to it.
A place's types are included in the response from a Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text
Search (New), and Autocomplete (New) request:
A place can have a single primary type from type Table A (#table-a) or type Table B (#table-b)
associated with it. For example, the primary type might be mexican_restaurant or
steak_house.The primary type may be missing if the place's primary type is not a supported
type. When a primary type is present, it is always one of the types in the types field.
A place can have multiple type values from type Table A (#table-a) or type Table B (#table-b)
associated with it. For example a restaurant might have the following types:
seafood_restaurant, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment.
The address and address components of a place can be tagged with certain types from the
Address types and address component types (#address-types) table. For example, an address
might be tagged as an street_address and a component of the address might be tagged as
a street_number.
You can also specify place types as part of a request. When specified in the request, the type acts
as a filter to restrict the response to only include places that match the specified types.

About the type tables
Table A (#table-a) lists the supported values for place types:
As part of a response from Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), and Text Search (New).
The values in Table A are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Nearby Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedTypes,
excludedTypes, includedPrimaryTypes, and excludedPrimaryTypes parameter. The values
in Table B are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Text Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedType parameter.
As part of a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) request, use as the values to the
includedPrimaryTypes parameter.
As part of a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) response.
Table B (#table-b) lists additional place type values which may also be returned as part of a Place
Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text Search (New), and Place Autocomplete Widget (New)
response. The request must specify at least one of the places.types or places.primaryType
fields in the field mask. Values from Table B may NOT be used as part of a request, except as the
values to the includedPrimaryTypes parameter for a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) request.
Address types and address component types (#address-types) list types that may appear in either or
both address type and address component type arrays in the response body. Address component
types are subject to change.

Address types and address component types
The types array in the response indicates the address type. Examples of address types include a
street address, a country, or a political entity. The types array in the
google.maps.places.AddressComponent class indicates the type of each part of the address.
Examples include street number or country.
Addresses may have multiple types. The types may be considered 'tags'. For example, many cities
are tagged with the political and locality types.
The following types are supported and returned in both the address type and address component
type arrays:
Address TypeDescription
street_addressA precise street address.
routeA named route (such as "US 101").
intersectionA major intersection, usually of two major roads.
2/6/26, 11:25 AMPlace Types  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers

politicalA political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil
administration.
countryThe national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by
the Geocoder.
administrative_area_level_1A first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States,
these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these
administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1
short names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely
circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are
based on a variety of signals and location data.
administrative_area_level_2A second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States,
these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these
administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_3A third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_4A fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_5A fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_6A sixth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_7A seventh-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a
minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
colloquial_areaA commonly-used alternative name for the entity.
localityAn incorporated city or town political entity.
sublocalityA first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one
of the additional types: sublocality_level_1 to
sublocality_level_5. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger
numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.
