- Before you begin
In this codelab, you learn everything that you need to get started with the vis.gl/react-google-
map (https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/) library for the Google Maps JavaScript API, which lets
you add a Google map to a React app. You learn how to get set up, load the Maps JavaScript API,
display your first map, work with markers and marker clustering, draw on the map, and handle user
interaction.
Note: vis.gl/react-google-map uses Google Maps Platform services. Use of Google Maps Platform services
through this library is subject to the Google Maps Platform Terms of Service.
vis.gl/react-google-map is not a Google Maps Platform Core Service. Therefore, the Google Maps Platform Terms
of Service (e.g., Technical Support Services, Service Level Agreements, and Deprecation Policy) do not apply to
this library.
You can read more about Support options (https://github.com/visgl/react-google-maps#support) in the

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#03/22

- While still in the /starter directory:
The starter project has been set up for you to use the Vite development server, which compiles and
runs the code that you write locally. Vite development server also automatically reloads your app in
the browser any time that you make code changes. If you follow the link provided at the end of the
build process you should find a web page that reads: "Hello, world!"
- If you want to run the full solution code, navigate to the /solution directory and complete the
same setup steps.
- Load the Maps JavaScript API
The foundation of using Google Maps Platform for the web is the Maps JavaScript API. This API
provides a JavaScript interface for using all the features of Google Maps Platform, including the
map, markers, drawing tools, and other Google Maps Platform services, such as Places.
To load the Maps JavaScript API with the React framework, you need to use the APIProvider
component that's part of the vis.gl/react-google-map (https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/)
library. This component can be added at any level of the app, typically somewhere at the top, and it
renders all child components unmodified. Besides handling the loading of the Maps JavaScript API,
it also provides context information and functions for the other components and hooks of this
library. The APIProvider is included in the vis.gl/react-google-map
(https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/) library, so it was installed when you ran npm install
earlier.
To use the APIProvider component, follow these steps:
- Open the /src/app.tsx file. This file is where you do all your work for this codelab.
- At the top of the file, import the APIProvider class from the @vis.gl/react-google-maps
(http://vis.gl/react-google-maps) library:
npmstart
import{APIProvider}from'@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
2/6/26, 11:23 AMAdd a Google map to a React app  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#04/22

- In the App function definition, set the APIProvider component's apiKey parameter with the
API Key created in the previous step and the onLoad property with a console log message:
The APIProvider component takes a series of properties that specify various options for loading
the Maps JavaScript API, including your Google Maps Platform API key, what version of the API you
want to load, and any additional libraries provided by the Maps JavaScript API that you want to
load.
The Google Maps API key is the only required property for APIProvider to function, and we
included the onLoad property for demonstration purposes. For more information, see
<APIProvider> Component
(https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/docs/api-reference/components/api-provider).
Your app.tsx file should look like this:
If everything is successful, you should see the console.log statement in the browser console.
Now that the Maps JavaScript API is loaded, you can render the dynamic map in the next step.
- Display a map
Time to display your first map!
<APIProviderapiKey={'Your API key here'}onLoad={()=>console.log('Maps API has loa
importReactfrom'react';
import{createRoot}from"react-dom/client";
import{APIProvider}from'@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
constApp=()=>(
<APIProviderapiKey={'Your API key here'}onLoad={()=>console.log('Maps API has lo
<h1>Hello,world!</h1>
</APIProvider>
## );
constroot=createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));
root.render(<App/>);
exportdefaultApp;
2/6/26, 11:23 AMAdd a Google map to a React app  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#05/22

The most commonly used part of the Maps JavaScript API is google.maps.Map, which is the class
that lets you create and manipulate map instances. The vis.gl/react-google-map
(https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/) library wraps this class in the Map component. First, import
the Map and MapCameraChangedEvent classes.
The Map component supports a variety of different settings for the map. For this codelab, you use
the following settings:
defaultCenter, which sets the latitude and longitude for the center of the map.
defaultZoom, which sets the initial zoom level of the map.
To display a map, place the following code within the APIProvider tags to center the map on
Sydney, Australia, and give it a zoom level of 13, which is the right zoom level to show the city
center:
You should now see a map of Sydney in your browser:
import{APIProvider,Map,MapCameraChangedEvent}from'@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
<Map
defaultZoom={13}
defaultCenter={{lat:-33.860664,lng:151.208138}}
onCameraChanged={(ev:MapCameraChangedEvent)=>
console.log('camera changed:',ev.detail.center,'zoom:',ev.detail.zoom)
## }>
</Map>

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#06/22

To recap, in this section you displayed a map with the <Map> component and set its initial state
with properties. You also used events to capture when the camera changed.
Your app.tsx file should look something like this:
- Add cloud-based map styling
importReactfrom'react';
import{createRoot}from"react-dom/client";
import{APIProvider,Map,MapCameraChangedEvent}from'@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
constApp=()=>(
<APIProviderapiKey={'Your API key here'}onLoad={()=>console.log('Maps API has lo
<Map
defaultZoom={13}
defaultCenter={{lat:-33.860664,lng:151.208138}}
onCameraChanged={(ev:MapCameraChangedEvent)=>
console.log('camera changed:',ev.detail.center,'zoom:',ev.detail.zoom)
## }>
</Map>
</APIProvider>
## );
constroot=createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));
root.render(<App/>);
exportdefaultApp;

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#07/22

A map ID is a requirement to use Advanced Markers, which you use to mark points of interest on
your map of Sydney. A map ID is also used for cloud-based map styling.
You can customize the style of your map using Cloud-based map styling
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/maps-customization-overview).
Create a Map ID
If you have not yet created a map ID with a map style associated to it, see the Map IDs
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id) guide to complete the following steps:
- Create a map ID.
- Associate a map ID to a map style.
Note: Using a Map ID on Maps SDK for Android or Maps SDK for iOS triggers a map load that is charged against
the Dynamic Maps SKU. See Google Maps Billing
(https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/pricing#dynamic-maps) for more information.
To use the map ID that you created, set the mapId property of the <Map> component:
You should see the style that you selected on the map!
- Add markers to the map
There are lots of things that developers do with the Maps JavaScript API, but putting markers on
the map is definitely the most popular. Markers let you show specific points on the map, and are a
<Map
defaultZoom={13}
defaultCenter={{lat:-33.860664,lng:151.208138}}
mapId='DEMO_MAP_ID'
onCameraChanged={(ev:MapCameraChangedEvent)=>
console.log('camera changed:',ev.detail.center,'zoom:',ev.detail.zoom)
## }>
</Map>

common UI element for handling user interaction. If you've used Google Maps before, you're
probably familiar with the default marker, which looks like this:
To use the AdvancedMarker component to put markers on the map, follow these steps:
- Create a list of objects to represent points of interest in the Sydney area, place it right below
your imports, outside of the App definition:
- Customize your pins with the <Pin> element:
typePoi={key:string,location:google.maps.LatLngLiteral}
constlocations:Poi[]=[
{key:'operaHouse',location:{lat:-33.8567844,lng:151.213108}},
{key:'tarongaZoo',location:{lat:-33.8472767,lng:151.2188164}},

- Create a custom component to render your list with Advanced Markers, place this below the
definition of App:
- Add the PoiMarkers component as a child of the Map component:
- Finally, add Pin and AdvancedMarker to your imports.
<Pinbackground={'#FBBC04'}glyphColor={'#000'}borderColor={'#000'}/>
constApp=()=>(
## ...
## );
constPoiMarkers=(props:{pois:Poi[]})=>{
return(

{props.pois.map((poi:Poi)=>(
<AdvancedMarker
key={poi.key}
position={poi.location}>
<Pinbackground={'#FBBC04'}glyphColor={'#000'}borderColor={'#000'}/>
</AdvancedMarker>
## ))}
## </>
## );
## };
<Map

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#010/22

You should see customized Advanced Markers on the map:
- Enable marker clustering
When using a lot of markers or markers that are in close proximity to one another, you may
encounter an issue where the markers overlap or appear too crowded together, which causes a bad
user experience. For example, after creating the markers in the last step, you may have noticed this:
## Pin
## }from'@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
2/6/26, 11:23 AMAdd a Google map to a React app  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#011/22

This is where marker clustering comes in. Marker clustering is another commonly implemented
feature, which groups nearby markers into a single icon that changes depending on the zoom level,
like this:
2/6/26, 11:23 AMAdd a Google map to a React app  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#012/22

The algorithm for marker clustering divides the visible area of the map into a grid, then clusters
icons that are in the same cell. Luckily, you don't have to worry about any of that because the
Google Maps Platform team created a helpful, open-source utility library called
MarkerClustererPlus that does everything for you automatically. You can view the source for the
MarkerClustererPlus library on GitHub
(https://github.com/googlemaps/v3-utility-library/tree/master/packages/markerclustererplus).
To enable marker clustering, follow these steps:
- At the top of the app.tsx file, lets update and add to our library imports and supporting types.
For the template project for this codelab, the MarkerClustererPlus utility library is already
included in the dependencies declared in the package.json file, so you already installed it when
you ran npm install at the beginning of this codelab.
- Create variables for the MarkerClusterer and supporting elements in the PoiMarkers
component.
You need an instance of the map to initialize the MarkerClusterer. Get that instance from the
useMap() hook:
- Create a list of markers stored in a state variable:
importReact,{useEffect,useState,useRef,useCallback}from'react';
import{createRoot}from"react-dom/client";
import{
APIProvider,
## Map,
AdvancedMarker,
MapCameraChangedEvent,
useMap,
## Pin
## }from'@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
import{MarkerClusterer}from'@googlemaps/markerclusterer';
importtype{Marker}from'@googlemaps/markerclusterer';
constmap=useMap();
const[markers,setMarkers]=useState<{[key:string]:Marker}>({});

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#013/22

- Store the clusterer as a reference:
- Also in your PoiMarkers component, create an instance of MarkerClusterer and pass it the
instance of the Map where you want the marker clusters displayed:
- Create an effect that updates the clusterer when the marker list changes:
- Create a function to mint references for new markers:
constclusterer=useRef<MarkerClusterer|null>(null);
useEffect(()=>{
if(!map)return;
if(!clusterer.current){
clusterer.current=newMarkerClusterer({map});
## }
## },[map]);
useEffect(()=>{
clusterer.current?.clearMarkers();
clusterer.current?.addMarkers(Object.values(markers));
## },[markers]);
constsetMarkerRef=(marker:Marker|null,key:string)=>{
if(marker && markers[key])return;
if(!marker && !markers[key])return;
setMarkers(prev=>{
if(marker){
return{...prev,[key]:marker};
## }else{
constnewMarkers={...prev};
deletenewMarkers[key];
returnnewMarkers;
## }
## });

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#014/22

- Use this method in the AdvancedMarker element to create the reference for each marker.
You should now see marker clusters on your map:
If you zoom in and out, MarkerClustererPlus automatically renumbers and resizes the clusters
for you. You can also click any marker cluster icon to zoom in and see all of the markers included in
that cluster.
## };
<AdvancedMarker
key={poi.key}
position={poi.location}
ref={marker=>setMarkerRef(marker,poi.key)}
## >
<Pinbackground={'#FBBC04'}glyphColor={'#000'}borderColor={'#000'}/>
</AdvancedMarker>

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#015/22

To recap, in this section you imported the open-source MarkerClustererPlus utility library and
used it to create an instance of MarkerClusterer that, with the help of React state and references,
automatically clustered the markers you created in the previous step.
Your PoiMarkers component should look like this:
constPoiMarkers=(props:{pois:Poi[]})=>{
constmap=useMap();
const[markers,setMarkers]=useState<{[key:string]:Marker}>({});
constclusterer=useRef<MarkerClusterer|null>(null);
// Initialize MarkerClusterer, if the map has changed
useEffect(()=>{
if(!map)return;
if(!clusterer.current){
clusterer.current=newMarkerClusterer({map});
## }
## },[map]);
// Update markers, if the markers array has changed
useEffect(()=>{
clusterer.current?.clearMarkers();
clusterer.current?.addMarkers(Object.values(markers));
## },[markers]);
constsetMarkerRef=(marker:Marker|null,key:string)=>{
if(marker && markers[key])return;
if(!marker && !markers[key])return;

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#016/22

Next, you learn how to handle user interaction.
- Add user interaction
Now you have a great looking map that displays some of Sydney's most popular tourist
destinations. In this section, you add some additional handling of user interactions with the event
system of the Maps JavaScript API to further improve the user experience of your map.
The Maps JavaScript API provides a comprehensive event system that uses JavaScript event
handlers to let you handle various user interactions in code. For example, you can create event
listeners to trigger code execution for interactions like the user clicking the map and markers,
panning the view of the map, zooming in and out, and more.
To add a click listener to your markers and then programmatically make the map pan so that the
clicked marker appears at the center of the map, follow these steps:
setMarkers(prev=>{
if(marker){
return{...prev,[key]:marker};
## }else{
constnewMarkers={...prev};
deletenewMarkers[key];
returnnewMarkers;
## }
## });
## };
return(
## <>
{props.pois.map((poi:Poi)=>(
<AdvancedMarker
key={poi.key}
position={poi.location}
ref={marker=>setMarkerRef(marker,poi.key)}
## >
<Pinbackground={'#FBBC04'}glyphColor={'#000'}borderColor={'#000'}/>
</AdvancedMarker>
## ))}
## </>
## );
## };
2/6/26, 11:23 AMAdd a Google map to a React app  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#017/22

- Create a click handler callback.
In the PoiMarkers component, define a click handler with React's useCallback().
The click event is triggered whenever a user clicks or taps a marker, and returns an event as a
JSON object with information about the UI element that was clicked. To improve the user
experience of the map, you can handle the click event and use its LatLng object to get the latitude
and longitude of the marker that was clicked.
Once you have the latitude and longitude, pass that to the Map instance's built-in panTo() function
to have the map smoothly pan to recenter on the clicked marker by adding the following in the
callback function of the event handler:
- Assign the click handlers to the markers.
The AdvancedMarker elements of the vis.gl/react-google-map
(https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/) library expose two properties that are helpful for handling
clicks:
clickable: If true, the AdvancedMarker will be clickable and trigger the gmp-click event, and
will be interactive for accessibility purposes. For example, it will allow keyboard navigation
with the arrow keys.
onClick: The callback function to call when a click event occurs.
- Update your PoiMarkers rendering to assign a click handler to each marker:
constPoiMarkers=(props:{pois:Poi[]})=>{
## ...
consthandleClick=useCallback((ev:google.maps.MapMouseEvent)=>{
if(!map)return;
if(!ev.latLng)return;
console.log('marker clicked:',ev.latLng.toString());
map.panTo(ev.latLng);
## });
## ...
## };
return(
## <>
{props.pois.map((poi:Poi)=>(
<AdvancedMarker

https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#018/22

- Go to the browser and click your markers. You should see the map automatically pan to
recenter when a marker is clicked.
To recap, in this section, you used the event system of React to assign a click handler to all of
markers on the map, retrieved the latitude and longitude of the marker from the fired click event,
and used that to recenter the map whenever a marker is clicked.
Only one more step to go! Next, you further improve the user experience of the map with the
drawing features of the Maps JavaScript API.
- Draw on the map
So far, you created a map of Sydney that shows markers for popular tourist destinations and
handles the user interaction. For the last step of this codelab, you use the drawing features of the
Maps JavaScript API to add an additional useful feature to your map experience.
Imagine that this map is going to be used by users who want to explore the city of Sydney. A useful
feature would be to visualize a radius around a marker when it's clicked. This would let the user
understand what other destinations are within walking distance of the clicked marker.
The Maps JavaScript API includes a set of functions for drawing shapes on the map, such as
squares, polygons, lines, and circles. The vis.gl/react-google-map
(https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/) library makes these capabilities available to you in React.
Next, you render a circle to show an 800-meter (approximately half-mile) radius around a marker
when it's clicked.
The starter repository contains a custom component for a circle element. You can find it in the
src/components/circle.tsx file.
To let users draw on the map, follow these steps:
## ...otherproperties...
clickable={true}
onClick={handleClick}
## >
## ...
</AdvancedMarker>
## ))}
## </>
## );
2/6/26, 11:23 AMAdd a Google map to a React app  |  Maps JavaScript API  |  Google for Developers
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#019/22

- Update your imports to include the provided Circle component.
- Create a state variable for the circle center.
Capture the state of the center of your circle in your PoiMarkers component. You set the initial
state to null, and lean into the fact that a circle won't render unless it has a valid center location
(and radius).
- Update the circle center when a click event is handled.
Call setCircleCenter with the location found in the event object:
The drawing functions in the Maps JavaScript API give you a wide variety of options for how a
drawn object appears on the map. To render a circular radius, set the properties of the circle
element, such as color and stroke weight, where the circle should be centered and its radius.
- Add a circle to your rendering and bind the center to your state variable. Your rendering
should look like this:
import{Circle}from'./components/circle'
constPoiMarkers=(props:{pois:Poi[]})=>{
## ...
const[circleCenter,setCircleCenter]=useState(null)
## ...
## };
consthandleClick=useCallback((ev:google.maps.MapMouseEvent)=>{
## ...
setCircleCenter(ev.latLng);
## });
return(
## <>

All done! Go to your browser and click one of the markers. You should see a circular radius
rendered around it:
## 10. Congratulations
strokeColor={'#0c4cb3'}
strokeOpacity={1}
strokeWeight={3}
fillColor={'#3b82f6'}
fillOpacity={0.3}
## />
{props.pois.map((poi:Poi)=>(
<AdvancedMarker
key={poi.key}
position={poi.location}
ref={marker=>setMarkerRef(marker,poi.key)}
clickable={true}
onClick={handleClick}
## >
<Pinbackground={'#FBBC04'}glyphColor={'#000'}borderColor={'#000'}/>
</AdvancedMarker>
## ))}
## </>
## );
## };
